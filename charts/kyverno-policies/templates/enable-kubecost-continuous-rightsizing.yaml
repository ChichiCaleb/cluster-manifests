      Kubecost is able to modify container resource requests and limits dynamically
      based upon observed utilization patterns and recommendations. This provides an
      easy way to automatically improve allocation of cluster resources by increasing
      efficiency. This policy will annotate all Deployments which have the label
      `env=test` with `request.autoscaling.kubecost.com/enabled="true"` if the annotation
      is not already present. Other annotations may be added according to need and users
      should see the documentation for a complete list.
